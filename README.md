# Charting-Library---iOS-Sample-App

This is a basic native iOS application built with ChartIQ's iOS Charting SDK. 
This provides an example of how to implement the most common elements in the library. This is not a comprehensive example, more like a good starting point for an iOS developer.

## About the iOS Charting SDK

The iOS Charting SDK has been designed to support this basic application and may need to be extended to support more elaborate implementations.
This can be done by adding additional code to invoke Javascript functions directly. 
Feel free to contact us and request sample code and guidance on how to extend the SDK.

## Requirements

* a valid version of ChartIQ's charting library (version 3.0 or greater). Please contact sales@chartiq.com if you do not already have a license or evaluation version.

## Getting started

Instructions for compiling the application and for using the native SDK can be found at:

http://documentation.chartiq.com/tutorial-Starting%20on%20iOS.html

Open the app in Xcode using xcworkspace file and build. **By default the app currently targets an older version of Swift than Xcode 9 prefers. The app will compile but if you would like to update the Swift target you must use Xcode's converter.**
