# Charting-Library---iOS-Sample-App

This is a basic iOS application built with ChartIQ's iOS Charting SDK. 
Both the SDK and this application are intended to provide guidance on how to implement a native menu that interacts with the most common API calls in the [javaScript library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).

## About the iOS Charting SDK

The iOS Charting SDK has been designed to support this basic application and may need to be extended to support more elaborate implementations.
This can be done by adding additional code to invoke Javascript functions directly. 
Feel free to contact us and request sample code and guidance on how to extend the SDK.

## Requirements

- a valid version of ChartIQ's charting library (version 7.0.2 or greater). Please contact sales@chartiq.com if you do not already have a license or evaluation version.

- This sample Mobile Application is written using Swift 3.
  - To run it, you will need to use Xcode version 10.0 or prior.
  - The following link can be used to the download it: https://developer.apple.com/download/more (Search for Xcode 10.0)

## Getting started

Instructions for compiling the application and for using the native SDK can be found at:

[http://documentation.chartiq.com/tutorial-Starting on iOS.html](http://documentation.chartiq.com/tutorial-Starting%20on%20iOS.html)

Open the app in Xcode using xcworkspace file and build. 
> Remember the app currently targets an older version of Swift than Xcode prefers. The app will compile but if you would like to update the Swift target you must use Xcode's converter.
