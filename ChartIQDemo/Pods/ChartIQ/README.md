# Charting-Library---iOS-SDK
Native iOS SDK for the ChartIQ javaScript [Charting Library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).

This SDK has been designed to support a [basic application](https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---iOS-Sample-App) and may need to be extended to support more elaborate implementations. This can be done by adding additional code to invoke Javascript functions directly. Feel free to contact us and request sample code and guidance on how to extend the SDK.

## Requirements

- A valid version of ChartIQ's charting library (version 7.0.3 or greater). Please contact sales@chartiq.com if you do not already have a license or evaluation version.
